# My Machine Learning Projects
This repo with some of my machine learning Project , Enjoy it   

**My next project is to devlop a bot who made or create a techno music if you wanna join my project let me know** 

## Projects description :

### __Customer__ __Martial__ __statuts__ __predection__ 

In this project, I tried to develop a machine learning model that tries to detect if a customer is single, married or divorced by understanding their behavior in the market. Go ahead and enjoy the project, the accuracy is not more than 70% because the data is small and unbalanced.  

* Data Preparation : 
  + Cleaning 
  + Clustring 
  + Feature engineering 

* Models : 
  + KNN 
  + Naive Bayes 
  + Random Forest  


### Financial sentiment analysis  


In this project, I developed two models of natural language analysis. The first one is clustring, where I instruct the machine to differentiate between macroeconomic and microeconomic information.The second model is the financial sentiment understanding of information such as good or bad news in the financial market 

* Data Preparation : 
    
    + Cleanning : regex , tokonizer  
    + Transform : Word to vec 
    
* Models : 
  + Clustering 
  + Random forset poor accuracy
  + Neural Network with 72% accuracy
